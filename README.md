As part of the project, we are planning to attack a multimodal classification model on the Hateful Memes and Memotion 7K dataset. The objective of the project is to minimize the classification accuracy by adversarially modifying the image and/or text of memes to maximise the misclassification of memes from hateful to non-hateful and vice-versa. Using the adversarially modified images and/or texts, the model will then be re-trained to improve its robustness.
